# Security Policy
Here at Apple, we believe privacy is a fundemental human right, where your own collection of information, is kept, but sometimes there could be chances where attackers can steal your personal
information. That's why at Apple, we are supporting it by putting security features that no other software has provided, like Secure Enclave, Folder permission and management, and more.
